### Hi there, I'm Shuo Shen ðŸ‘‹

I'm a freelance developer and a master student with a double degree major in [Earth Oriented Space Science and Technology](https://www.tum.de/studium/studienangebot/detail/espace-earth-oriented-space-science-and-technology-master-of-science-msc) from The Technische UniversitÃ¤t MÃ¼nchen and Wuhan University.

ðŸ”­ I'm working for the master thesis at LiangDao GmbH, the topic is Semantic Segmentation with Transfer Learning for Mobile Laser Scanning Point Cloud. [A new project](https://github.com/PointCloudProcessing) was created purposely by me to collect related work.
In the past, I was the principal software developer for a food delivery company where I worked full-stack to build their website and Apps that serve 
tens of thousands of customers. 

ðŸ˜„ When not working with technology, I geek out on MOBA games on the phone, and binge-watch movies/television sitcoms. I enjoy diving to the bottom of the water and forgetting about the whole world. I'm also proud to support "Verein der chinesischen Studenten und Wissenschaftler in MÃ¼nchen e.V. (CSSA)", the world's largest student run philanthropy.
